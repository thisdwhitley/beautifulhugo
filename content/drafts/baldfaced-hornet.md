Today I learned what a Baldfaced Hornet looks like. I learned this because I also learned what it felt like to be stung by one. I was honestly not doing anything to disrupt this guy and all of a sudden felt him right under my arm. I thrashed violently and knocked him on the ground. <!--more-->When I saw the size of this thing it truly looked foreign. I had never seen one before and didn’t know if I was going to have some sort of reaction or if it was some sort of rare, incredibly poisonous bug. So I stomped on it a few (dozen) times and picked it up with some sticks. I brought it inside and put it in a container so that a) when I told anyone the size of this thing they would believe me and b) just in case I had to go to the emergency room I could show them what got me.

Obviously I did some research on this guy. It was very distinctive looking so I I figured I could pick it out of a Google Image lineup when I searched for “stinging insects north carolina.” Sure enough I quickly identified it as a baldfaced hornet. While I was reading up on the natural habit and how they’re typically docile (…?!) I didn’t realize but the pain was subsiding. I would liken the sting to getting shot by a BB gun on uncovered sunburned skin after the BB gun was pumped 10 times, the pain went away pretty quickly. The sting area swelled up pretty large and the area around the sting was really inflamed, but it did not bother me after I got over the imaginary paralysis I made up.

Full disclosure: I got stung on Friday, not Sunday when I am writing this. And for the record, I hate baldfaced hornets now.
