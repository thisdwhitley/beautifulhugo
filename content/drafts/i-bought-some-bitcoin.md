<p>The title is admittedly a little click-baity, but I had to buy Bitcoin solely to convert it to Siacoin.  Consider this post a precursor on my journey as I set up a decentralized cloud storage platform that uses a blockchain to facilitate payments.<!--more--></p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>As part of <a href="http://www.ilearnedthisthehardway.com/my-next-quest-an-open-source-alternative-to-evernote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my quest</a> to set up synchronized storage I have decided to use this as an opportunity to learn about blockchain. I will be using <a href="https://sia.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sia</a> as a way to synchronize local storage across numerous devices via a decentralized cloud. Sia requires the use of Siacoin, which can be <a href="http://www.buyingsiacoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchased</a> or mined. I intend on address the mining aspect of it later, but for now I would just like to purchase enough Siacoin to get started.</p>
<p>From what I've gathered, I need to buy Bitcoin (<a href="https://walletinvestor.com/currency/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) so that I can convert it to Siacoin (<a href="https://walletinvestor.com/currency/siacoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SC</a>), so that I can put it in my sia wallet. This "<a href="https://www.buyingsiacoin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to buy Siacoin</a>" (buyingsiacoin.com) page appears to be very thorough and I will be following it, except I am currently skipping steps 1-10 because I am going to be installing the sia daemon in a later post. <em>Also, as I'm writing this I am waiting for the consesus database to download in order to <a href="https://siawiki.tech/daemon/bootstrapping_the_blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bootstrap the blockchain</a>, and it is downloading <strong>PAINFULLY</strong> slow [<strong>UPDATE:</strong> it finished after 10+ hours!].</em></p>
<h4>01 Buy Bitcoin</h4>
<p>I have decided to use <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a3d811780551301a24b7e80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> [&lt;affiliate link] to purchase Bitcoin. I followed the instructions on the buyingsiacoin page which were very accurate.  I will say that it felt uncomfortable to take a picture of my driver's license in order to purchase something supposedly anonymous and untrackable, but I went ahead and did that.  Expect this verification to take some time.  But you will get an email once it is complete, so go take a break (this took about an hour in my case).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like a US bank, Coinbase is regulated by the US government, and has to follow strict financial rules. So they take verifying your identity very seriously. It's a pain, but it does give Coinbase a reputation for being the most trusted way to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After verifying your identity, you must add a form of payment. Using a credit/debit card means higher fees but offers instant purchasing. Using a bank transfer is cheaper but slower (taking up to a week to get your coins). I chose to use a credit card and I created a "ShopSafe" number with a specified limit on it through Bank of America. I'm not sure why I chose to do this but I imagine it will bite me later on if I ever use Coinbase again. I like to make things difficult for myself apparently.</p>
<p>Based on an <a href="https://walletinvestor.com/converter/siacoin/usd/500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online calculator</a>, presently, 500 SC costs a little more than 14 USD. As a side note; when I started writing the post yesterday, 500 SC was the equivalent of 9 USD.  That a significant change shows the volatility of this market and it makes me a bit weary.  My exploration might be happening at the worst time due to the huge run-up in all cryptocurrencies as of late...I've never had good timing.  All the same, to get started I have decided to purchase 20 USD worth of BC to convert to SC because I'm not sure of what sort of conversion or transfer fees I'll run into.</p>
<h4>02 Convert to Siacoin</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, at the time I'm writing this post, the recommended exchange page (<a href="https://bittrex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bittrex</a>) is not accepting new customers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we have to make a few upgrades to our support and backend systems to handle the increased traffic and load. As such, we have halted new user registrations for the time being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while the <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/getting-started-with-private-decentralized-cloud-storage-c9565dc8c854" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Started</a> page from Sia mentions a few other exchanges, I have been thrilled with the detail provided by the buyingsiacoin.com page and prefer to continue to follow those instructions. So I will wrap up this post (it is getting lengthy anyway) with the single mission of purchasing Bitcoin accomplished.</p>
<p>I feel relatively safe having only purchased Bitcoin and not yet converting it on an exchange. So I will leave it for the time being and revisit this once I'm able to register with Bittrex...I probably won't check again until after the US holidays.</p>

<h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
<p>I will need to pick this up again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on Bittrex</li>
<li>Convert my newly purchased BTC to SC</li>
<li>Install/configure Sia on my headless server</li>
<li>Transfer SC to my Sia wallet</li>
</ul>
