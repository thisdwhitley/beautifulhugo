As I noted previously, I've just been laying hose out all over the yard and
*attempting* to coil it as neatly as possible at one of the excessive ends.
Well, today I cut a lot of hose and eliminated some of the excess.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

There are likely a *lot* of benefits to having the hoses only be as long as they
need to be.  Things like the fact that reducing the distance that water has to
flow through the hose will
[reduce the friction](https://frictionlosscalculator.com) and (hopefully) result
in more pressure at the end.  (***side note:*** *I should probably care more
about this since I'm not really starting strong with the limitations and
considerations I've written of previously, but I'd be lying if I said I knew all
the numbers in my situation to do that calculation...*)  

The real, and pretty stupid, reason I initially wanted to cut the hose to the
right lengths was because I thought I'd be able to retrieve my good 50' hose
which I ended up using as the end hose in zone 4.  I thought that if I cut some
of the other hoses, I could use the remainder in the place of my good hose and
place it (neatly coiled) back on its rack.  

Turns out that was not the case.  I neglected to do any actual measurements or
math which is a pretty big shocker.  But every 50' hose I used would leave me
***just barely*** too short for that last run.  So I had to buy a
[Repair Shank Mender](https://amzn.to/2OO4kjj) to adjoin two of the smaller
pieces into a hose that would reach the final sprinkler in Zone4.  

> PRO-TIP: it was an absolute bitch to get the hose ends ONTO that shank...but if you heat up the hose (think hot water) it will be much more pliable


I have already noted my current schedule, but I will now be modifying it in the
hopes of aligning with the general guidance of:

> On the third week 30-35 minute run times should be fine

I have interpreted that as:

    <td class="tg-c3ow">45</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### NEXT STEPS

Wait and see.

### SIDE NOTES

* So basically, the modification is to only water once a day (Cycle A), but for
  twice as long 
* I cannot justify actually doing twice as long in Zone 4 because there is
  already standing water in the bottom of the ditch...
