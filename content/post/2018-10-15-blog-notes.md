I would like to make a note on my blog.  Currently I'm using hugo, github, and
netlify.  I'm ***currently*** using the
[beautifulhugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) theme, but here are
some things that I'd like to change (I need to learn more about
[submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)):

- change the colors to red (more notes here)
- make note that links may be affiliate
- have categories in the top bar

And there is a fork that has some items that I like and need to reproduce:

- find in the top bar
- small "share" icons
- similar posts (based on tags)
- categories
- docker social page
